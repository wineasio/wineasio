1. INSTALLATION
---------------

Do the following to build for 32-bit Wine.
# make clean
# make 32

To install (substitute with the path to the 32-bit wine libs for your distro).
# sudo cp build32/wineasio.dll.so /usr/lib32/wine/wineasio.dll.so 

Do the following to build for 64-bit Wine.
# make clean
# make 64

To install (substitute with the path to the 64 bit wine libs for your distro).
# sudo cp build64/wineasio.dll.so /usr/lib/wine/wineasio.dll.so 

Finally the dll must be registered in the wineprefix.
For both 32 and 64 bit wine do:
# regsvr32 wineasio.dll

On a 64 bit system with wine supporting both 32 and 64 applications, regsrv32
will register the 32-bit driver in a 64 bit prefix, use the following command
to register the 64 bit driver in a 64 bit wineprefix:

# wine64 regsvr32 wineaiso.dll

regsvr32 registers the ASIO COM object in the default prefix "~/.wine".
To use another prefix specify it explicitly, like:
# env WINEPREFIX=~/asioapp regsvr32 wineasio.dll

2. GENERAL INFORMATION
----------------------

ASIO apps get notified if the jack buffersize changes.

WineASIO can slave to the jack transport.

WineASIO can change jack's buffersize if so desired. Must be enabled in the registry, see below.

The configuration of WineASIO is done with Windows registry (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\WineASIO).
All these options can be overridden by environment variables.
There is also a GUI for changing these settings, which WineASIO will try to launch when the ASIO "panel" is clicked.

The registry keys are automatically created with default values if they doesn't exist when the driver initializes.
Th available options are:

[Number of inputs] & [Number of outputs]
These two settings control the number of jack ports that WineASIO will try to open.
Defaults are 16 in and 16 out.  Environment variables are WINEASIO_NUMBER_INPUTS and WINEASIO_NUMBER_OUTPUTS.

[Autostart server]
Defaults to off (0), setting it to 1 enables WineASIO to launch the jack server.
See the jack documentation for further details.
The environment variable is WINEASIO_AUTOSTART_SERVER, and it can be set to on or off.

[Connect to hardware]
Defaults to on (1), makes WineASIO try to connect the ASIO channels to the physical I/O ports on your hardware.
Setting it to 0 disables it.
The environment variable is WINEASIO_CONNECT_TO_HARDWARE, and it can be set to on or off.

[Fixed buffersize]
Defaults to on (1) which means the buffer size is controlled by jack and WineASIO has no say in the matter.
When set to 0, an ASIO app will be able to change the jack buffer size when calling CreateBuffers().
The environment variable is WINEASIO_FIXED_BUFFERSIZE and it can be set to on or off.

[Preferred buffersize]
Defaults to 1024, and is one of the sizes returned by GetBufferSize(), see the ASIO documentation for details.
Must be a power of 2.

The other values returned by the driver are hardcoded in the source,
see ASIO_MINIMUM_BUFFERSIZE which is set at 16, and ASIO_MAXIMUM_BUFFERSIZE which is set to 8192.
The environment variable is WINEASIO_PREFERRED_BUFFERSIZE.

Be careful, if you set a size that isn't supported by the backend, the jack server will most likely shut down,
might be a good idea to change ASIO_MINIMUM_BUFFERSIZE and ASIO_MAXIMUM_BUFFERSIZE to values you know work on your system before building.

In addition there is a WINEASIO_CLIENT_NAME environment variable, that overrides the JACK client name derrived from the program name.
