1. INSTALLATION
---------------

Copy the file asio.h from Steinberg's ASIO SDK to the wineasio source
directory.

Wineasio by default uses 32 bit float as sample format (the native format used
by Jack), if this causes a problem for an ASIO host, wineasio can be built to
use 32 bit integer by defining the ASIOST32INT variable.  Do this by defining
ASIOST32INT in the source code or by passing it as an argument to the compiler.

Do the following to build for 32 bit Wine.
# make clean
# make

To install (substite with the path to the 32 bit wine libs for your distro).
# sudo cp wineasio.dll.so /usr/lib32/wine/wineasio.dll.so 

To build for 64bit Wine a shellscript has been added to modify asio.h and make
it compatible with both 32 and 64bit Wine/Linux.  A separate Makefile has also
been added for 64bit.

Do the following to build for 64bit Wine.
# ./prepare_64bit_asio
# make clean
# make -f Makefile64

To install (substite with the path to the 64 bit wine libs for your distro).
# sudo cp wineasio.dll.so /usr/lib/wine/wineasio.dll.so 

Finally the dll must be registered in the wineprefix.
For both 32 and 64 bit wine do:
# regsvr32 wineasio.dll

On a 64 bit system with wine supporting both 32 and 64 applications, regsrv32
will register the 32 bit driver in a 64 bit prefix, use the following command
to register the 64 bit driver in a 64 bit wineprefix:

# wine64 regsvr32 wineaiso.dll

regsvr32 registers the ASIO COM object in the default prefix "~/.wine".
To use another prefix specify it explicitly, like:
# env WINEPREFIX=~/asioapp regsvr32 wineasio.dll

2. GENERAL INFORMATION
----------------------

The wineasio driver has been almost completely refactored, so the changes are
far too many to explain in detail. These are some of the more obvious changes:

Wineasio takes advantage of a new function in the jack api, which lets jack
create the wine callback thread.  This results in a much cleaner callback
without having to wait on semaphores, requires jack1 (0.117.0) or jack2 (1.9.4)
or later.

The default sample type has been changed to use ASIOSTFloat32LSB, which is the
native format of jack, and allows the removal of the sample rate conversion
from the processing callback.

Wineasio can now slave to the jack transport.

Support has been added for jack's bufsize_callback(), meaning that asio apps
get notified if the jack buffersize changes.

CreateBuffers() can now change jack's buffersize if so desired.  Must be
enabled in the registry, see below.

The old configuration file has been removed and been replaced by a registry key
(HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\WineASIO).  All these options can be overriden
by an environment variable.  The key is automatically created with default
values if it doesn't exist when the driver initializes. It contains the
following values:

[Number of inputs] & [Number of outputs]
These two settings control the number of jack ports that wineasio will try to
open.  Defaults are 16 in and 16 out.  Environment variables are
WINEASIO_NUMBER_INPUTS and WINEASIO_NUMBER_OUTPUTS

[Autostart server]
Defaults to off (0), setting it to 1 enables wineasio to launch the jack
server.  See the jack documentation for further details. The environment
variable is WINEASIO_AUTOSTART_SERVER, and it can be set to on or off.

[Connect to hardware]
Defaults to on (1), makes wineasio try to connect the asio channels to the
physical I/O ports on your hardware.  Setting it to 0 disables it. The
environment variable is WINEASIO_CONNECT_TO_HARDWARE, and it can be set to on
or off.

[Fixed buffersize]
Defaults to on (1) and is the old behaviour where the buffer size is controlled
by jack and wineasio has no say in the matter.  When set to 0, an asio app will
be able to change the jack buffer size when calling CreateBuffers(). The
environment variable is WINEASIO_FIXED_BUFFERSIZE and it can be set to on or
off.

[Preferred buffersize]
Defaults to 1024, and is one of the sizes returned by GetBufferSize(), see the
ASIO documentation for details.  Must be a power of 2. The other values
returned by the driver are hardcoded in the source, see ASIO_MINIMUM_BUFFERSIZE
which is set at 16, and ASIO_MAXIMUM_BUFFERSIZE which is set to 8192. The
environment variable is WINEASIO_PREFERRED_BUFFERSIZE.  Be careful, if you set
a size that isn't supported by the backend, the jack server will most likely
shut down, might be a good idea to change ASIO_MINIMUM_BUFFERSIZE and
ASIO_MAXIMUM_BUFFERSIZE to values you know work on your system before building.

In addition there is a WINEASIO_CLIENT_NAME environment variable, that
overrides the JACK client name derrived from the program name.
