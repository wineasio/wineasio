# WineASIO

WineASIO provides an ASIO to JACK driver for WINE.  
ASIO is the most common Windows low-latency driver, so is commonly used in audio workstation programs.

You can, for example, use with FLStudio under GNU/Linux systems (together with JACK).

For best results with Debian-based distributions,
enable the [KXStudio repositories](https://kx.studio/Repositories) and install WineASIO from there.

### BUILDING

Do the following to build for 32-bit Wine.

```sh
make 32
```

Do the following to build for 64-bit Wine.

```sh
make 64
```

### INSTALLING

To install 32-bit WineASIO (substitute with the path to the 32-bit wine libs for your distro).

```sh
sudo cp build32/wineasio32.dll /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/wine/i386-windows/
sudo cp build32/wineasio32.dll.so /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/wine/i386-unix/
```

To install 64bit WineASIO (substitute with the path to the 64-bit wine libs for your distro).

```sh
sudo cp build64/wineasio64.dll /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wine/x86_64-windows/
sudo cp build64/wineasio64.dll.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wine/x86_64-unix/
```

#### EXTRAS

For user convenience a `wineasio-register` script is included in this repo, if you are packaging WineASIO consider installing it as part of WineASIO.

Additionally a control panel GUI is provided in this repository's `gui` subdir, which requires PyQt5 to build and run.  
The WineASIO driver will use this GUI as the ASIO control panel.

### REGISTERING

After building and installing WineASIO, we still need to register it on each Wine prefix.  
For your convenience a script is provided on this repository, so you can simply run:

```sh
wineasio-register
```

to activate WineASIO for the current Wine prefix.

#### CUSTOM WINEPREFIX

The `wineasio-register` script will register the WineASIO driver in the default Wine prefix `~/.wine`.  
You can specify another prefix like so:

```sh
env WINEPREFIX=~/asioapp wineasio-register
```

### GENERAL INFORMATION

ASIO apps get notified if the jack buffersize changes.

WineASIO can slave to the jack transport.

WineASIO can change jack's buffersize if so desired. Must be enabled in the registry, see below.

The configuration of WineASIO is done with Windows registry (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\WineASIO`).  
All these options can be overridden by environment variables.  
There is also a GUI for changing these settings, which WineASIO will try to launch when the ASIO "panel" is clicked.

The registry keys are automatically created with default values if they doesn't exist when the driver initializes.
The available options are:

#### [Number of inputs] & [Number of outputs]
These two settings control the number of jack ports that WineASIO will try to open.  
Defaults are 16 in and 16 out.  Environment variables are `WINEASIO_NUMBER_INPUTS` and `WINEASIO_NUMBER_OUTPUTS`.

#### [Autostart server]

Defaults to off (0), setting it to 1 enables WineASIO to launch the jack server.  
See the jack documentation for further details.  
The environment variable is `WINEASIO_AUTOSTART_SERVER`, and it can be set to on or off.

#### [Connect to hardware]
Defaults to on (1), makes WineASIO try to connect the ASIO channels to the physical I/O ports on your hardware.  
Setting it to 0 disables it.  
The environment variable is `WINEASIO_CONNECT_TO_HARDWARE`, and it can be set to on or off.

#### [Fixed buffersize]
Defaults to on (1) which means the buffer size is controlled by jack and WineASIO has no say in the matter.  
When set to 0, an ASIO app will be able to change the jack buffer size when calling CreateBuffers().  
The environment variable is `WINEASIO_FIXED_BUFFERSIZE` and it can be set to on or off.

#### [Preferred buffersize]
Defaults to 1024, and is one of the sizes returned by `GetBufferSize()`, see the ASIO documentation for details.  
Must be a power of 2.

The other values returned by the driver are hardcoded in the source,  
see `ASIO_MINIMUM_BUFFERSIZE` which is set at 16, and `ASIO_MAXIMUM_BUFFERSIZE` which is set to 8192.  
The environment variable is `WINEASIO_PREFERRED_BUFFERSIZE`.

Be careful, if you set a size that isn't supported by the backend, the jack server will most likely shut down,
might be a good idea to change `ASIO_MINIMUM_BUFFERSIZE` and `ASIO_MAXIMUM_BUFFERSIZE` to values you know work on your system before building.

In addition there is a `WINEASIO_CLIENT_NAME` environment variable,
that overrides the JACK client name derived from the program name.
